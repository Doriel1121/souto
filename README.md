## On boarding application

### Introduction
Souto application comes to solve the problem of on boarding process when you work from home.

Few examples: 
* A new employee at Microsoft starts to work at the R&D of ExcellOnline team from home
* Multiple students start their first year at Ben-gurion university from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic

The application gives the employee / each of the students, the ability to understand at any moment exacly what he suppose to do.
His supervisor might not being able to communicate with him 24/7, but with the help of Souto App he, the supervisor, can define the exact process of accepting a new employee / student.
The employee / student knows exacly what is waiting for him in the on-boarding, and can manage his process with the help of the application by saying exacly what he had done, what he is doing, and what he didnt do yet.

### How it works
The application is divided to 2 parts:
1. Employer - Called a Captain
2. Employee - Called a Sailor

The captain creates a board in which he says exacly what the on boarding process includes:
* He create a ticket of each step that should be taken

The captain also have the ability to follow his sailors progress and see if any of them is having a problem with doing a ticket

The sailor, on the other hand - is the one that log in to a board and start the on-boarding process. He sees all the the tickets that he needs to do - and can mark them as 'In progress' when he works on them, or as 'Done' when he is finished.
The on boarding process is finished once the sailor had done all of the tickets.
The sailor have the ability to indicate that he has a problem with doing a specific ticket - and the captain will immediatly know about it.
